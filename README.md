# Loan-Record

Loan Record is an easy way to keep track of all your loans and their due dates. Keep track of your payments and estimate your future loan payments seamlessly.

• Take a quick glance at the loan's highlights to see important information like the due date or the monthly payment. 

• Use the graph to examine in detail what your future balances, principal and interest payments will be. 

• Get your amortization payment schedule in an easy to read table format.

• Stay informed of upcoming payments using the color coded loan overview.

• Use the What If calculators to answer hypothetical questions like, "when am I going to finish paying off this credit card or what's would be my monthly payment for a loan with these terms".
